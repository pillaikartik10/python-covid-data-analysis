# Web Scraping and Basic Data Analysis on COVID Data using Python  

A basic project in Python and Jupyter Notebook, to scrape and analyse some Coronavirus-related data.  
  
[*app.py*](https://www.github.com/pillaikartik10/python-covid-data-analysis/blob/main/app.py) is the **Python** source code for scraping data from [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). It uses BeautifulSoup library to parse the data from the website. The resultant data is stored in csv format with the file name *corona.csv*.     
  
Basic data analysis is done on the *corona.csv* file using **Jupyter Notebook**.([*data_processing.ipynb*](https://www.github.com/pillaikartik10/python-covid-data-analysis/blob/main/data_processing.ipynb)).    
The data is checked, and duplicate and unnecessary rows are removed. Column data types are changed to more suitable formats. Graphical representation of the data is demonstrated.
